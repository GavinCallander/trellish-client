# Trellish
## Overview
Trello is one of my favorite sites ever and not only from a practical standpoint. 

As a dev who designs like a dev, great design is something that never ceases to amaze me and the simple, yet sleak, UI of Trello makes it one of my favorite sites to visit.

From a development standpoint, there's a lot going on; from its "on-the-fly" updates to the back end, to interesting manipulation on the front end.

So, I guess this is my ode to "the board". One humble developer's attempt at making something that's not quite Trello, but, hopefully, very much Trellish.
